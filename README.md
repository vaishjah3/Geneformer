# README

## Implementation

To implement the code, there are two `.ipynb` files:

- `gene_classification_pancreas.ipynb`
- `cell_classification_pancreas.ipynb`

For data analysis, refer to the `Data_analysis.ipynb` file.

## Dataset

Download the Figshare dataset using the following command:

```bash
!wget https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/43480497 -O data.zip

Pretrained Weights
Pretrained weights required to run the code can be found here:

Source Code
Some parts of the source code can be downloaded from the link below.
Please place them under the geneformer/ folder before running gene_classification_pancreas.ipynb and cell_classification_pancreas.ipynb:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JMp_n15m0tQvCTAL7TvQ6vpj14jkVGgO/view?usp=drive_link

 For eg:- the perturber_utils.py file present in the zip folder should be geneformer/perturber_utils.py while running the notebooks.
